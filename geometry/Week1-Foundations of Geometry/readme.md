## 🔭 Week 1: Foundations of Geometry

**Goal**: Understand basic objects and relationships.

🧠 **Concepts:**
* Points, lines, vectors
* Distance between points
* Angle between vectors
* Dot product, cross product

🐍 **Python:**
* Write functions: `distance(p1, p2)`, `dot(v1, v2)`, `angle(v1, v2)`
* Practice basic vector math with NumPy

🌐 **JavaScript (p5.js):**
* Plot points and lines
* Animate vector rotation or angle display
