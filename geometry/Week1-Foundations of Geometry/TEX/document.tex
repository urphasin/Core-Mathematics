	\chapter{Problems Involving Triangles}
	
	\textbf{Week 1:}
	
	\subsection*{Key Definitions}
	
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
		\item \textbf{Point:} A point is a basic unit of geometry that represents a location in space. It has no size, width, length, or depth—just position.
		\item \textbf{Plane:} A plane is a flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely in all directions.
		\item \textbf{Line:} A line is a straight one-dimensional figure with no thickness that extends infinitely in both directions.
		\item \textbf{Segment (Line Segment):} A segment or a line segment is a part of a line that has two endpoints. It is the straight path connecting two specific points.
		\item \textbf{Triangle:} A triangle is a polygon with three sides and three vertices, formed by connecting three non-collinear points with line segments.
		\item \textbf{Collinear Points:} Points that lie on the same straight line are called collinear. In the statement, the phrase “do not lie on the same line” means the points are non-collinear.
	\end{enumerate}
